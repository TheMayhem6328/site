                        As someone who used to hoard thousands of online songs, I needed a way to keep it organized, so
                        I retrieved song metadata from partial tags, which I got from my source, and filled it the rest
                        of it through the Spotify API, and used Mutagen to write the tags to the files using Python.

                    <p>
                        Back in high school, I had a tough time learning pseudocode, because even though it had a pretty
                        defined syntax, I couldn't execute it, since it's not a real language. I learn through
                        experimentation, therefore not being able to execute the code was hindering my learning. So
                        naturally, I made a transpiler for it which would transpile the pseudocode to python, therefore
                        making it executable.

                        had to compete against 25 groups of two to solve various problems, exploring

                        and robotics. Before the event was held, a workshop was organized for students at North
                        South, introducing us to the basics of robotics, including Arduino and ESP32 programming,
                        From there, I also explored Computer Aided Design (CAD) software like AutoCAD and Fusion
                        360.

                        wish to work with both hardware and software. Therefore, to attain more knowledge on hardware,
                        Bs.EEE was a no-brainer.
